# Sentiment_Analysis_Web_App
it's a simple web page that a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our recurrent neural network model deployed on Amazon SageMaker which will predict the sentiment of the entered review and return prediction result to show it on the web page.

# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
